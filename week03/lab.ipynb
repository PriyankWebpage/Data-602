    "- To create forecasts, supervision is required.\n",
    "- Supervised learning requires us to train the model with labels before it gains knowledge to anticipate the outcome and this makes it fall short of AI\n",

    "- Supervision is not required to train model using unsupervised learnig technique\n",
